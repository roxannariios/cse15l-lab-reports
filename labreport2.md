## Part 3
From today's lab, I essentially got more comfortable working with ssh and logging into the school's server. I also learned a new command called ```scp``` which allows us to transfer files onto the server we have connected to our account. From lab2, I learned how to access this server. I'm glad we had more time to experiment on it so we could have a better idea on what exactly we can do on it.
